*** Project PoEtato synopsis notes ***

- Minimum API Level 21

- Internet Communication, Firebase (google play service!), LiveData, ViewModel

- Locked Portrait Orientation only (because I hate rotation in apps)

- Swipe to return to previous Activity or click on the Menu Navigation

- League/Trade API will use notification to remind or track changes to the User.

- Trade API is the last priority, Ladder/League should be enough to fill all criterias,
	but Trade API will be worked upon if the others are at a satisified point.
	
- Service is used to update Ladder info every 10 min,
	and for Trade API it will check every 1 min if user is tracking an item.
	
- Color Scheme must be something dark that won't annoy the user. (or perhaps two different color schemes).

- Help can be found from:
	^ pathofexile.com/developer/docs/api
	^ pathofexile.gamepedia.com

	^ reddit.com/r/pathofexiledev
- poe.ninja also offers API regarding pricing of items which can be used for a "Stash Tab API".




* Future Work
	- Ingame Whisper Notification (huge work, requires PC programming)
	

	
	
* Requirements to Synopsis
	- Front page (project/app title, names of participants with study numbers and study direction (e.g. "IKT")
    - Table of contents with page numbers. All pages of the document must be numbered.
    - App vision: What does you app do - which problem does it solve and for who, and where?
    - Personal vision: What do you want to achieve while build it? (What you hope to get out of working on this task?)
    - Context: A rich picture is a great way to illustrate the intended features of your app.
    - Define the requirements for you app through Use Cases / Cases / User Stories. 
    - Early design overview:
			^ Make a diagram of what major components your app will have and how they should communicate
			^ What will be the main risks in your proposed app and design
			^ Other considerations that can help you, like simple time schedule
